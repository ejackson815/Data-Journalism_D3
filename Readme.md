## Background

Have you heard of the phrase an apple a day keeps the doctor away?  Well I would like to modify that to the following: A few drinks a day keeps the paychecks coming in?  From the data, it appears that as Employment per state increases, so does the % of heavy drinkers ( 2 drinks or more).  Why is this?  Does alcohol increase productivity or are we just that dependant on it as a stress releiver.  More research to come over the next few weeks.
